          <h2 class="short-description">José Rizal, born in 1861, was a Filipino nationalist who symbolized resistance against Spanish colonial rule. His education, initially under private tutors and later in Europe, fueled his passion for justice and learning. Through essays and novels like "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," he exposed colonial abuses and inspired Filipino activism. Despite his peaceful intentions, he was executed in 1896 at age 35 for sedition. Rizal's martyrdom ignited the Filipino quest for independence, and his legacy of patriotism and social justice endures today.</h2>

                  <h4>Early Childhood Education (1861-1872):</h4>
                  <p>Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines. He was the seventh of eleven children of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. His parents recognized his intellectual potential early on and provided him with basic education at home. His mother, Teodora, who was highly educated herself, played a significant role in his early education, teaching him reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>
                  
                  <h4>Formal Education at Ateneo Municipal de Manila (1872-1877):</h4>
                  <p>At the age of 11, Rizal was sent to Manila to pursue formal education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, one of the most prestigious schools in the Philippines at the time. He studied under the Jesuit order and excelled academically, particularly in literature, art, and languages. Rizal's time at Ateneo helped shape his critical thinking skills and instilled in him a sense of social justice.</p>
  
                  <h4>University Education in Europe (1878-1882):</h4>
                  <p>In 1878, at the age of 17, Rizal traveled to Europe to pursue higher education, following the wishes of his parents who wanted him to become a doctor. He enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid in Spain, where he pursued a degree in Medicine and also took courses in philosophy and letters. During his time in Europe, Rizal's exposure to the intellectual and political climate of the continent deeply influenced his nationalist sentiments and advocacy for reforms in the Philippines.</p>
  
                  <h4>Further Studies in Europe and Expanding Horizons (1882-1887):</h4>
                  <p>Rizal continued his studies in Europe, moving to Paris, Heidelberg, and then to Berlin. He continued his medical studies, specializing in ophthalmology, while also immersing himself in the cultural, social, and political milieu of Europe. He became fluent in several languages, including Spanish, French, German, and English. His experiences in Europe broadened his perspectives on nationalism, colonialism, and social justice, shaping his views on the Philippines' plight under Spanish colonial rule.</p>
  
                  <h4>Return to the Philippines and Political Activism (1887-1892):</h4>
                  <p>After completing his studies, Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1887. He became actively involved in advocating for reforms and social change through his writings and political activities. His novels, "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule, sparked nationalistic fervor and played a crucial role in the Philippine Revolution.</p>
